# VIBES EMS
AI Doctor for QB-CORE

# Description :

This script is designed for servers where EMS or doctors are not available. Players can pay to receive immediate assistance and be revived on the spot by a doctor arriving in a moving ambulance.


# Features:

- **Enhanced Roleplay Experience:** This script is perfect for large servers, offering players more immersive roleplay opportunities by reducing the need for constant respawning or just sitting around.
- **Responsive EMS Ped:** The EMS ped in the ambulance can respond from any location, ensuring timely and well-coordinated assistance regardless of where you are on the map.
- **Configurable Notifications:** Tailor the script notifications to your server's needs. Choose from various notification systems such as QB-Notify, OkokNotify, Mythic Notify, or even provide your own custom notification function.
- **Phone Integration:** If you're using a phone system like lb-phone, the script can send notifications directly to the player's phone, enhancing the immersive experience.
- **Obstacle Navigation:** The EMS ped is now smarter and can navigate around obstacles, including vehicles, to reach the player more efficiently.
- **Seamless Integration:** Designed to enhance roleplay and minimize respawning, this script is compatible with the QBCORE framework.
- **Community Collaboration:** Hosted on GitHub, this script welcomes pull requests. Feel free to contribute by adding useful changes and improvements.
- **Open Usage Policy:** Use this script freely to enhance your server, but please don't edit and resell it.
- **Shoutouts:** Big thanks to @hh_aidoc for the fork. https://github.com/hhfw1/hh_aidoc
